## Setup and install

### Project installation and server

You must use Node (It doesn't work with Node 12 and upper)

```
○ → node -v
v11.15.0
```

Now you've pulled down the repo you'll need to `cd` into the directory that you cloned the repo into and run some quick tasks:

```
cd <currency-alex-one-web-app-angularjs>
npm install
```

This will then setup all the development dependencies we need.

Now simply run this to boot up the server:

```
npm start
```

The app will be available at the link below:

```
http://localhost:4000/#!/app
```

Everything you do will be inside of `/src`, and everything is compiled and outputted inside `/dist`, this is the same for both local development and deployment.
